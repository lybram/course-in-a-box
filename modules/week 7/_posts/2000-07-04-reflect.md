### Reflect:

As a group, debrief what you did and did not like about this process. What do you want to remember for the next time you give or receive feedback?

Based upon the feedback you received today, write down notes for yourself about any changes you want to make to your presentation. 

What is one way you might use what you learned about feedback in your personal or professional life?
