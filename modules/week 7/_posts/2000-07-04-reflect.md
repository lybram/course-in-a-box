### Reflect:
How will you use what you practiced today to help achieve a personal or professional goal? 

#### Next Week:
Take notes on your elevator pitch and work on perfecting your pitch before the next class. If you are completing this course for credit, please work on finalizing a draft of your portfolio that you can share for feedback in lieu of the elevator speech.
