### Activity:

In groups of three, share your revamped elevator speech or your portfolio with the group. Listen and or read carefully to each presentation and write down your answers to [these questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hxlc30qZjQyouKPHNaP3skDwLihtF2wC3i5cnoHNaLE/edit?usp=sharing) for each:

1. What was the most interesting or engaging thing about this presentation?
1. Where did you want more detail or another example? Why?
1. What other evidence might this person include to support their submission?
1. Does the final reflection show development of the Big 10 over time? If not, how might it do that?

Then, try practicing Rennigerâ€™s four-part formula to provide your feedback to your peers:
1. Ask a micro-yes question
1. Give a data point
1. Impact statement
1. End on a question
