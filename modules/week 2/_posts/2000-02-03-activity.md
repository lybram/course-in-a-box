**Using the Big 10 rubrics**

Watch this video, [“What are rubrics?”](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Yi93iUg8zUn4tEKePehwpZ2k85ccKG5L/view?usp=sharing) on using the Big 10 rubrics to do a quick, initial self assessment.

Take a few minutes to look through the rubric and identify the 2 skills that you believe are your strongest and the 2 that you suspect are your weakest.

If you are interested, you can dig deeper into the work College Unbound students do with the Big 10 on [The Big 10 Resource Page](https://collegeunbound.digication.com/Big10resources/about-me) and other ways CU students earn credit for their learning from experience on [The LIP Resource Page](https://collegeunbound.digication.com/LIP/learning-in-public).

**Engaging Your Network**

We all can use [a little help from our friends](https://youtu.be/rUVEFkjqiEE). When it comes to recognizing our strengths, getting input from others from across our life (friends, family, co-workers, mentors, employers) can help us recognize core strengths.

Take a few minutes to brainstorm a list of 5-10 people who can provide you with feedback on your strengths. Share two of your ideas with other members of the learning circle. 

**[Download the Big 10 Request Form to complete the following activity.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14a_raGWLf93CJExC4fVwlUXzuUV-6pc5jCFryg3BQfc/edit?usp=sharing)**

For this exercise, send the Big 10 Request form to at least five people in your network and ask them to complete it in the next week.

It is likely that all five may not be able to get it back to you, and that is okay. People are busy. Next week, you'll be asked to reflect upon what you learned from the people who were able to respond to your request.
