## Activity

**Engaging Your Network**

We all can use [a little help from our friends](https://youtu.be/rUVEFkjqiEE). When it comes to recognizing our strengths, getting input from others from across our life (friends, family, co-workers, mentors, employers) can help us recognize core strengths.

Take a few minutes to brainstorm a list of 5-10 people who can provide you with feedback on your strengths. Share two of your ideas with other members of the learning circle. 

For this exercise, [download this Big 10 request form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14a_raGWLf93CJExC4fVwlUXzuUV-6pc5jCFryg3BQfc/edit?usp=sharing) and send it to at least five people in your network and ask them to complete it in the next week.

It is likely that all five may not be able to get it back to you, and that is okay. People are busy. Next week, you'll be asked to reflect upon what you learned from the people who were able to respond to your request.
