### Activity:

**Mapping your growth**

üêù Buzz / Draw-Pair-Share 

In this activity, we are focusing on telling the story of your development of the Big 10 that you have identified as your strongest.

Think back to the very first time you can remember yourself using this skill. Then, draw a timeline that starts with this first experience and includes at least two other times in which you learned something new, faced a challenge, or otherwise developed this Big 10. Keep in mind that for growth failing at something, and then understanding why you failed, is as important (if not more so) than success. For each point on this timeline, draw something will help you recall this moment in your development. 

Turn to your neighbor and tell them the story of your timeline. Listen to each other‚Äôs story and then ask questions where you would like more detail or clarification.

Taking their feedback into consideration, share your story with the full group.
