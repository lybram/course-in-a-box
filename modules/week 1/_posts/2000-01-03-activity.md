### Activity:

**Map your process**

Thinking back to the experience that you described to your partner, sketch out your process of moving from experience to learning, then compare it to the process described by Kolb or any of the reflective practice models presented here [(Reflective Practice Models)](https://www.ucd.ie/teaching/t4media/reflective_practice_models.pdf).

* What is similar? 
* What is different? 
* What might you want to try next time? 

Share your sketch and your conclusions about your process with the group.
