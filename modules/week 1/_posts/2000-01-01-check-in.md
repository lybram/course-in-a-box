1. **Think** of 3 times when youâ€™ve had an experience in which you learned something
1. **Pair up** with a partner and tell the story of a key moment in one of these experiences. To tell your story, consider four of the ingredients of a good story:
* Set the stage for this moment: Where were you, when was it, what was happening?
* Take us there: Include details not only about what you thought, but also what you experienced through your senses. What did you see, hear, smell, taste, touch?
* Tell us about the other characters in your story: Who was involved and what did they do?
* Finally, tell us how the story ends: What was the result or consequence of this experience? 
1. **Share** with the full group a superpower you see in your partner based upon their story
