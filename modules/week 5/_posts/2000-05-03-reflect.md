### Reflect:

What core strengths did you hear reflected back to you from your partner? Return to your Big 10 drafting document and add to it the examples of strengths that surfaced in your GKI. 

Then, debrief the GKI experience with the group. What did or did not work well? What surprised, interested, or raised questions for you? What do you want to remember about the experience of doing a GKI?
