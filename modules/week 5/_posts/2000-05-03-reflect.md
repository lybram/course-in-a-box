### Reflect:

What core strengths did you hear reflected back to you from your partner? Which Big 10s did you demonstrate? 

Then, debrief the GKI experience with the group, sharing your responses to the following:
* What Big 10s did you hear in your partnerâ€™s stories?
* What do you want to remember about the experience of doing a GKI?
